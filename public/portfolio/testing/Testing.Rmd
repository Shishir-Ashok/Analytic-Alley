# This is a test

- Wanting to check how Rmd files would work on Hugo
- Did it work?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(mtcars)


cbp1 <- c("#AEC6CF", "#77DD77", "#FDFD96", "#FFB7CE", "#CFCFC4", 
          "#FFB347", "#FF6961", "#B2F7EF", "#C1B7F6", "#FFD1B3", 
          "#77DDC7", "#FF9AA2", "#D1FF99", "#9DFBF5", "#DDA0DD")
