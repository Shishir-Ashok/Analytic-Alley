## Exploring Diwali Sales Data

### Context

- The Diwali Sales dataset, featured in the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-11-14/readme.md) for the week of November 14, 2023, provides a comprehensive look at retail sales during the Diwali festival in India. It offers a detailed snapshot of consumer behavior during one of the most significant festive periods in India.

### Key Business Questions

1. **Which age group spends the most during Diwali?**
2. **How does expenditure vary across genders within each age group?**
3. **What are the common occupations of individuals in the highest spending age group?**
4. **Which states have the highest spending, and how does this vary by gender?**
5. **How does marital status influence spending patterns across different states and genders?**

### Insights and Trends

1. **Age Group Spending:** 
    - The age group 26-35 spends the most during Diwali. This demographic is likely to have higher disposable income and a greater inclination towards festive shopping.
    
2. **Gender-Based Expenditure:**
    - Within each age group, spending patterns vary significantly between genders. In general, females tend to spend more than males across all age groups.
    
3. **Occupational Insights:**
    - For individuals aged 26-35, the predominant occupations are in IT, healthcare, aviation, and banking. This suggests that marketing strategies aimed at these professional groups could be advantageous.

4. **State-Wise Spending:**
    - States such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi rank among the highest in spending.

5. **Marital Status Influence:**
    - Married individuals tend to spend more than unmarried ones. This trend is consistent across both genders.

### Recommendations

1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**
    - Focus marketing efforts on the 26-35 age group, especially targeting professionals and business owners. Tailor campaigns to highlight products and offers that appeal to this demographic.

2. **Gender-Specific Strategies:**
    - Develop gender-specific marketing strategies. For example, create campaigns that resonate with female consumers in high-spending states.
    
3. **State-Specific Promotions:**
    - Implement state-specific promotions, particularly in states with high spending. Customize offers and discounts to cater to the preferences of consumers in these regions.
    
4. **Enhanced Customer Engagement:**
    - Use insights from occupational data to engage with customers through personalized communication. Offer exclusive deals and loyalty programs for professionals.

### Data Cleaning
- Renaming Andhra\\xa0Pradesh to Andhra Pradesh.
- Converting Marital_Status column values to a factor.
    - This would help with clear color differentiation for 1 (as red) and 2 (as blue), instead of a color range of values between 0 and 1.
- Removing columns that contain only NA values.
- Getting rid of rows where there aren't any values recorded for the Amount column.

```{r}
diwali <- diwali |> 
    mutate(State = recode(State, "Andhra\xa0Pradesh" = "Andhra Pradesh"), .keep = "all" ) |> 
    mutate(Marital_Status = as.factor(Marital_Status)) |>
